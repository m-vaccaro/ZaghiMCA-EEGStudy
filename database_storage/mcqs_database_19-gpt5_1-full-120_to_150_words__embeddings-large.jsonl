{"question": "Why might a modern bridge contain more compliant joints and sliding interfaces than a layperson expects?", "choices": {"A": "They improve overall reliability by allowing controlled movement instead of relying on absolute rigidity.", "B": "They are cheaper to construct than traditional rigid steel components in all situations.", "C": "They are mainly decorative features that enhance the visual appearance of the bridge.", "D": "They eliminate the need for any numerical modeling or field measurements during design."}, "correct_answer": "A", "explanation": "The paragraph explains that controlled movement through compliant joints and sliding interfaces leads to higher overall reliability, replacing the illusion of absolute rigidity, which matches option A. The text does not say these features are primarily for cost savings (B), decoration (C), or that they remove the need for modeling and measurements (D)."}
{"question": "How does Leah’s understanding of her physics homework change as she works on it?", "choices": {"A": "She stops paying attention to the equations and begins daydreaming about sports involving balls.", "B": "She decides the problem is too easy and finishes it quickly without checking her work again.", "C": "She goes from seeing it as a one-answer puzzle to seeing it as a lesson in how small choices shape motion and even how she can plan her week.", "D": "She realizes the problem has no clear solution and gives up trying to understand the motion of the ball."}, "correct_answer": "C", "explanation": "The paragraph explains that Leah first sees the assignment as a puzzle with one correct answer, then notices how small changes affect the ball’s path, and finally applies that step-by-step reasoning to planning her week, which is described in option C. Options A, B, and D introduce ideas (daydreaming, finding it too easy, or giving up) that are not mentioned in the paragraph."}
{"question": "What conclusion does the author reach about mismatches between model predictions and experimental results?", "choices": {"A": "They indicate that systems biology is an unreliable approach to understanding cells.", "B": "They show that more single, precise measurements are needed instead of complex models.", "C": "They can be valuable, because specific failures can reveal deeper organizing principles of biology.", "D": "They prove that biological processes are too random to be described by any model."}, "correct_answer": "C", "explanation": "The author explains that over time they have come to welcome mismatches between models and experiments, because such specific failures can expose hidden assumptions and reveal new, deeper organizing principles. The other options incorrectly claim that mismatches make systems biology unreliable, demand more single measurements, or prove biology is too random, none of which is stated in the paragraph."}
{"question": "What does the writer realize was the main improvement after using the Python script in the lab?", "choices": {"A": "That the script ran much faster after changing the sorting method", "B": "That testing on messy sample folders was more important than organizing real data", "C": "That enforcing a simple file-saving rule and creating a shared habit mattered more than the code itself", "D": "That storing notes in a CSV file was the only useful part of the script"}, "correct_answer": "C", "explanation": "The writer concludes that the main improvement was the simple rule the script enforced and the resulting shared habit, not the code itself, so C is correct. A is wrong because speed is mentioned but not as the main benefit. B is wrong because the focus is on long-term organization, not just testing. D is wrong because the CSV feature is not singled out as the primary improvement."}
{"question": "What did Lin decide to do after confirming that the system was strongly consistent and the leader election converged?", "choices": {"A": "She committed the patch and quietly scheduled a larger scale experiment for the next morning", "B": "She rolled back all her changes and restored the previous version of the logging service", "C": "She shut down the entire cluster and planned to retire the distributed logging system", "D": "She disabled all automated tests and chose to rely only on manual monitoring in production"}, "correct_answer": "A", "explanation": "The paragraph states that after the tests showed strong consistency and the leader election converged, Lin committed the patch and scheduled a larger scale experiment for the next morning, which matches option A. The other options describe actions—rolling back changes, shutting down the system, or disabling tests—that are not mentioned in the paragraph and contradict its description of her next steps."}
{"question": "What do scientists gain by mapping feedback loops in biological systems?", "choices": {"A": "They can calculate the exact number of organs in an organism.", "B": "They can decide which species belong in a particular ecosystem.", "C": "They can completely stop any changes from happening in the system.", "D": "They can predict how a system will react to stress, such as changes in climate or food supply."}, "correct_answer": "D", "explanation": "The paragraph states that by mapping feedback loops, researchers can predict how a system reacts to stress like changes in climate or food supply, which matches option D. Options A and B are not mentioned as uses of feedback loops, and option C is incorrect because negative feedback reduces changes but does not stop all changes entirely."}
{"question": "What was the main outcome of the author’s habit of keeping a separate notebook during the second year of their PhD?", "choices": {"A": "They dramatically improved the numerical accuracy of their scattering code and fixed several computational bugs.", "B": "They realized that the structure of the Hilbert space was irrelevant to their research and stopped studying it.", "C": "They gained a clearer understanding of which parts of the quantum field theory formalism were essential and which were just convenient.", "D": "They discovered a completely new physical phenomenon that changed the direction of their research."}, "correct_answer": "C", "explanation": "The paragraph states that by the end of the semester, the author had not discovered any new physics but understood much more clearly which parts of the formalism were essential and which were merely convenient, matching option C. Options A and B are not mentioned in the text, and D is explicitly contradicted by the statement that no new physics was discovered."}
{"question": "What did the narrator realize by the end of the engineering lab activity?", "choices": {"A": "That using thicker wooden sticks is the only way to build a strong bridge", "B": "That sandbags are not a reliable way to test how much weight a bridge can hold", "C": "That geometry, planning, and careful building can turn an idea into a strong working structure", "D": "That sketching designs first is unnecessary because the bridge will fail anyway"}, "correct_answer": "C", "explanation": "The narrator concludes that basic geometry, patient planning, and careful building can turn a rough idea into a sturdy, working structure, which matches option C. The paragraph does not say that thicker sticks are the only way to build strong bridges (A), that sandbags are unreliable (B), or that sketching is unnecessary or that the bridge will fail (D)."}

The other options (electronics noise, uranium, and cosmic rays) are examples of backgrounds that are shielded, modeled, or subtracted, not the ultimate limiting background."}
{"question": "Why does the narrator keep the unedited version of the model after the final review?", "choices": {"A": "To remind themselves that their own engineering habits might be the least reliable part of any future design", "B": "To use it as the official version submitted to impress the judges in the capstone review", "C": "To share it with classmates so they can copy the most efficient settings for their own projects", "D": "To prove to the advisor that conservative settings always produce higher grades in engineering courses"}, "correct_answer": "A", "explanation": "The paragraph states that the narrator kept the unedited model as a reminder that their engineering habits may be the least reliable component in future designs. The other options add purposes—impressing judges, sharing with classmates, or proving a grading pattern—that are not supported by the text."}
{"question": "What consequence did Marta face after discovering the flaws in her reliability model?", "choices": {"A": "She fixed the model quickly and submitted it to the major conference on time.", "B": "She and her advisor withdrew the model, archived the results, reframed the project as a case study, and delayed her graduation by at least a semester.", "C": "She abandoned systems engineering entirely and switched to a different graduate program.", "D": "She was asked to repeat the entire degree program from the beginning."}, "correct_answer": "B", "explanation": "The paragraph explains that Marta and her advisor decided to withdraw the model, archive the results, reframe the work as a case study in modeling pitfalls, and that this would delay her graduation by at least one semester. Options A, C, and D describe outcomes that are not mentioned or contradicted by the paragraph."}
{"question": "What was the main feeling the student had by the end of the physics lab activity?", "choices": {"A": "Confidence from getting results that matched the textbook examples", "B": "Relief that the instructor’s explanation solved all the problems", "C": "Excitement about discovering a new type of motion not covered in class", "D": "Uneasiness from collecting confusing data that did not clearly make sense"}, "correct_answer": "D", "explanation": "The paragraph ends with the student feeling uneasy because the data did not match expectations and they did not really understand what happened, which matches option D. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because the student did not achieve matching results, did not feel fully satisfied by the instructor’s explanation, and was not excited about a new discovery."}
{"question": "Why was Lina told that her careful data did not actually count by the end of the week?", "choices": {"A": "Because she had accidentally mislabeled the petri dishes at the beginning of the experiment", "B": "Because she forgot to check and record the bacterial colonies on some of the days", "C": "Because no bacterial colonies appeared on any of the plates in the incubator", "D": "Because the incubator temperature was far below the protocol level, so the colonies did not grow under the right conditions"}, "correct_answer": "D", "explanation": "The paragraph explains that on Friday the incubator temperature was far below the level in the protocol, so even though colonies grew, they did not grow under the correct conditions, making her data invalid. There is no mention that Lina mislabeled dishes (A), skipped daily checks (B), or failed to grow any colonies (C)—in fact, it says every plate had grown colonies."}
{"question": "What central concern does the paragraph highlight about highly optimized distributed systems?", "choices": {"A": "They usually fail because the engineers lack basic understanding of consensus protocols and containers.", "B": "Their many abstraction layers and local optimizations create complex failure modes and align behavior with metrics that people do not fully trust.", "C": "They tend to collapse frequently since they ignore latency budgets and cost constraints during design.", "D": "Their main problem is that they expose too many low-level details instead of hiding operating systems and algorithms."}, "correct_answer": "B", "explanation": "The paragraph explains that added abstractions expand failure modes beyond any one engineer’s understanding and that systems misbehave because each part is locally optimized, resulting in architectures aligned with untrusted metrics, which matches option B. Option A is wrong because the text says systems are not poorly engineered. Option C is wrong because latency and cost constraints are followed, not ignored. Option D is wrong because the concern is about hiding complexity, not exposing too many low-level details."}
{"question": "What is one main effect of practicing algorithmic thinking, as described in the paragraph?", "choices": {"A": "It mainly helps people understand how computer hardware works inside machines.", "B": "It teaches people to avoid breaking problems into smaller parts and to trust their first guess.", "C": "It helps people see patterns and organize confusing problems in everyday situations like homework or schedules.", "D": "It only improves how people write code and has little impact outside the computer."}, "correct_answer": "C", "explanation": "The paragraph explains that algorithmic thinking helps people see patterns in everyday things like homework, sports tactics, and school schedules, making confusing problems look organized and testable, which matches option C. Option A is wrong because the focus is on ideas, not hardware. Option B is the opposite of the description, since algorithmic thinking does break problems into smaller parts. Option D is incorrect because the paragraph says it changes how people understand everyday life more than technology."}
{"question": "What major realization did the writer have about the true focus of their physics course?", "choices": {"A": "That physics is mainly about memorizing as many formulas as possible.", "B": "That physics is mostly about mysterious substances like energy that cannot be explained.", "C": "That physics is really about patterns of change and how quantities respond when others change.", "D": "That physics topics such as circuits and planetary motion are completely unrelated to each other."}, "correct_answer": "C", "explanation": "The writer says they expected to memorize formulas but realized the real subject was patterns of change and how quantities respond when others change, which matches option C. Option A repeats the initial misconception, B contradicts the explanation of energy, and D conflicts with the statement that circuits and planetary motion started to look similar."}
{"question": "What is one experiment that students can perform using the optical tweezers apparatus described in the paragraph?", "choices": {"A": "They can map the local viscosity of a fluid by oscillating the sample stage with a piezoelectric actuator.", "B": "They can measure the temperature of the vacuum chamber by heating the beads with the laser beam.", "C": "They can determine the color spectrum of the infrared laser by scanning it across different filters.", "D": "They can calculate the mass of the objective lens by monitoring its response to gravity."}, "correct_answer": "A", "explanation": "The paragraph states that by oscillating the sample stage with a piezoelectric actuator, students can map the local viscosity of a fluid or measure the stiffness of a DNA tether.

The text does not mention excitement (B), full understanding and pride (C), or indifference and lack of concern (D)."}
{"question": "What conclusion does the narrator reach by the end of the described week in the lab?", "choices": {"A": "They decide to abandon the qPCR project entirely and switch to a different research field.", "B": "They determine that the problem lies solely in the ELISA reagents being past their ideal window.", "C": "They recognize that the week has produced no usable data and has led to a delayed dissertation chapter and growing self-doubt.", "D": "They conclude that the fluctuating housekeeping gene does not matter because the cytokine measurements are still reliable."}, "correct_answer": "C", "explanation": "The paragraph ends with the narrator noting that the true outcome of the week is not data, but a postponed dissertation chapter and increasing doubt about their lab competence, which matches option C. Option A is incorrect because there is no mention of abandoning the project or field. Option B is wrong because multiple issues are described, not just ELISA reagents. Option D is incorrect because the fluctuating housekeeping gene is presented as a serious problem, not something that can be ignored."}
{"question": "What change helped Lina’s rover successfully navigate around the wall during the obstacle course test?", "choices": {"A": "She replaced the wheels with larger foam wheels so the rover could roll over the wall.", "B": "She tightened all the screws even more so the rover would stay firmly together.", "C": "She installed stronger motors so the rover could move faster past the barrier.", "D": "She turned the bending front bumper into a simple contact sensor using foil, wires, and tape."}, "correct_answer": "D", "explanation": "The paragraph explains that Lina noticed the bumper bending and then used foil, wires, and tape to turn it into a contact sensor, after which the rover reversed and went around the barrier, so D is correct. A is wrong because the foam wheels were already added and did not solve the problem. B is wrong because she had already checked the screws and that did not fix the issue. C is wrong because stronger motors were only suggested by others and were not the change that led to success."}
{"question": "What was Lian’s final approach to dealing with the artifact caused by condensation droplets in her assays?", "choices": {"A": "She treated the gradient they created as an internal spatial control and corrected the drug response curves using it", "B": "She discarded all affected plates and repeated the entire series of experiments from the beginning", "C": "She adjusted the incubator temperature to eliminate the gradient and ignored the existing data", "D": "She recalibrated the plate reader and manually removed all outlying values from the dataset"}, "correct_answer": "A", "explanation": "The paragraph states that Lian did not discard the data but instead incorporated the gradient as an internal spatial control, which led to corrected drug response curves. She did not discard all plates and restart (B), change only temperature while ignoring data (C), or rely on recalibrating the plate reader and deleting outliers (D)."}
{"question": "What best describes how Maya’s understanding of biology has changed by the end of the semester?", "choices": {"A": "She decides biology is mostly about memorizing long lists of terms and definitions.", "B": "She concludes biology only explains small organisms like bacteria, not larger systems.", "C": "She feels biology is mainly about lab experiments and not connected to everyday life.", "D": "She comes to see biology as a way of thinking that connects health, environment, and responsibility."}, "correct_answer": "D", "explanation": "The paragraph states that by the end of the semester, biology “felt like a way of thinking that linked health, environment, and responsibility,” which matches choice D. Choices A, B, and C contradict the text, which explains that she moved beyond memorization, saw biology as relevant to many scales of life, and connected it to everyday issues rather than only lab work."}
{"question": "What data layout strategy is described as a straightforward way to reduce coherence traffic and improve throughput on a multicore CPU?", "choices": {"A": "Placing all frequently updated counters together in a single cache line", "B": "Storing every array element in a different level of cache", "C": "Placing unrelated counters in separate cache lines", "D": "Using smaller cache line sizes for all levels of cache"}, "correct_answer": "C", "explanation": "The paragraph explicitly states that placing unrelated counters in separate cache lines is a straightforward technique for reducing coherence traffic and improving throughput, so C is correct. A is the opposite of the suggestion, B is not mentioned, and D is not discussed as a strategy in the paragraph."}
{"question": "By the time construction started, what does the narrator describe as the main result of the project?", "choices": {"A": "Developing a highly sophisticated spreadsheet that captured every calculation in detail", "B": "Gaining a clearer understanding of how to trace each design decision back to its governing constraint", "C": "Removing all regulatory limits so the design space was completely open", "D": "Returning to an earlier method of treating system design as isolated calculations"}, "correct_answer": "B", "explanation": "The paragraph states that by the time construction started, the main result was a clearer understanding of how to trace every decision back to its governing constraint. The other options contradict the text: the spreadsheet became less important (A), regulatory limits still constrained the design (C), and the narrator moved away from viewing design as isolated calculations (D)."}

It does not mention stack traces as decisive (A), hardware failures (B), or user reports (C) as the key clues."}
{"question": "What was the unexpected application that emerged from the researchers’ study of Arctic ground squirrel microbes in mice?", "choices": {"A": "Developing new high-fat diets that increase body mass in cold environments", "B": "Designing targeted probiotics that could help prevent obesity without changing diet or exercise", "C": "Creating warmer laboratory housing to reduce brown fat activity in experimental animals", "D": "Identifying methods to decrease resting energy expenditure to conserve energy in humans"}, "correct_answer": "B", "explanation": "The paragraph states that the project, which began as a way to model seasonal metabolism, now guides the development of targeted probiotics that may help prevent obesity without altering diet or exercise, which matches option B. The other options are not mentioned: A talks about increasing body mass, C about changing housing temperature, and D about decreasing energy expenditure, none of which are described as goals or outcomes of the study."}
{"question": "What is one main reason the researchers perform these small laboratory turbulence experiments?", "choices": {"A": "To invent new types of fluorescent dyes for use in medical imaging", "B": "To reduce the need for high-speed cameras in future fluid experiments", "C": "To obtain spectral signatures that can also help interpret turbulence in distant interstellar gas clouds", "D": "To eliminate the effects of temperature on the behavior of turbulent water flows"}, "correct_answer": "C", "explanation": "The paragraph states that the desktop experiments provide spectral signatures that are also used to interpret radio observations of turbulence in interstellar gas clouds, which matches option C. The text does not mention inventing dyes (A), reducing the need for cameras (B), or eliminating temperature effects (D); instead, it notes temperature is carefully controlled, not removed."}
{"question": "What change ultimately led to the major performance improvement in the data processing pipeline?", "choices": {"A": "Carefully tuning branch prediction and optimizing the hottest loop", "B": "Relying more heavily on sampling profilers and cache miss counters", "C": "Applying vectorization, lock-free queues, and memory alignment tweaks", "D": "Removing half the pipeline stages and merging several microservices into one bounded process"}, "correct_answer": "D", "explanation": "The paragraph states that the real breakthrough occurred when the author removed half the pipeline stages and merged several microservices into a single carefully bounded process. The other options (A, B, and C) describe efforts that were tried earlier but did not significantly improve runtime."}
{"question": "What surprising discovery did the researchers make while calibrating the resistance thermometer in the low temperature lab?", "choices": {"A": "The apparent drift in the measurement was actually a quantitative signature of lattice dynamics inside the sensing wire.", "B": "The thermometer’s calibration curve exactly matched the manufacturer’s smooth curve with no noticeable deviations.", "C": "Liquid nitrogen baths completely eliminated all sources of noise in the thermometer measurements.", "D": "The fluctuation dissipation theorem was invalid for describing microscopic defect motion in metals."}, "correct_answer": "A", "explanation": "The paragraph explains that the “bothersome drift” in the bridge output turned out to be a direct, quantitative fingerprint of lattice dynamics in the sensing wire, making A correct. B is wrong because the data did not align with the manufacturer’s smooth calibration curve. C is incorrect because there was still excess noise and drift present. D is wrong because the 1/f knee in the power spectral density matched what the fluctuation dissipation theorem predicts, not the opposite."}
{"question": "What do many respiratory microbiome studies ultimately produce as their most reliable outcome?", "choices": {"A": "A definitive map of all contaminant bacteria found in PCR reagents", "B": "A stable and universally agreed-upon list of core lung microbial genera", "C": "A new type of bronchoalveolar lavage sample that avoids background noise", "D": "A carefully validated, reproducible protocol with standardized methods and acceptable background profiles"}, "correct_answer": "D", "explanation": "The paragraph explains that the most robust outcome of many projects is a carefully validated protocol, effectively a reproducible pipeline, rather than a stable list of core lung genera. Thus D is correct. A, B, and C are not supported: contaminants are controlled, not mapped as the main outcome (A), a stable core lung list is explicitly said to be lacking (B), and no new sample type is described (C)."}
{"question": "What is the main design focus in the ecosystem-based view of infrastructure described in the paragraph?", "choices": {"A": "Planning periodic repairs of individual components after they fail", "B": "Shaping information flows and control structures so disturbances are absorbed locally", "C": "Eliminating feedback loops to keep the system behavior simple and predictable", "D": "Maximizing oversized safety margins to prevent any need for adaptation"}, "correct_answer": "B", "explanation": "The paragraph explains that, in the ecosystem-based view, the main design problem is shaping information flows, control hierarchies, and decision thresholds so local disturbances are absorbed before they propagate, which matches option B. Option A emphasizes periodic repair, which the paragraph contrasts with the new view. Option C incorrectly says feedback is eliminated, while the text stresses systems as governed by feedback. Option D focuses on oversized safety margins, which the paragraph says are de-emphasized in favor of observability and automated reconfiguration."}
{"question": "Why do bridge designers intentionally make some connectors act as weak links in the structure?", "choices": {"A": "To reduce the number of inspections needed during the bridge’s lifetime", "B": "To eliminate the need for expansion joints in hot and cold weather", "C": "To make the steel beams flex more under the weight of passing trucks", "D": "To ensure that if damage grows, these parts fail first and protect the main structure"}, "correct_answer": "D", "explanation": "The paragraph states that some connectors are designed as weak links so that if damage grows, they fail first and protect the main structure, which matches option D. Option A is incorrect because inspections are specified separately, not reduced. Option B is wrong because expansion joints, not weak links, handle temperature changes. Option C is incorrect because the goal is not to increase flexing of the steel beams."}
{"question": "What is the main implication the paragraph draws about certain biological systems?", "choices": {"A": "Some biological systems have inherent randomness that places fundamental limits on how well their behavior can ever be predicted.", "B": "Most variability in biological experiments can be eliminated by increasing sample size and improving experimental protocols.", "C": "Variability in gene expression is mainly due to poor experimental design and execution rather than properties of the systems themselves.", "D": "Deterministic models are always sufficient to explain phenotypic distributions in genetically identical cells."}, "correct_answer": "A", "explanation": "The paragraph argues that intrinsic noise in biological systems creates genuine indeterminacy, leading to hard limits on prediction; this matches option A. Option B contradicts the text, which says some variability cannot be erased. Option C is wrong because it states that variability is mainly due to poor design, while the paragraph says well-designed experiments still face real randomness. Option D is incorrect because the paragraph says phenotypic distributions defy simple deterministic models."}
{"question": "Why did the committee decide that Lina’s thesis project no longer had a viable path forward?", "choices": {"A": "Because the dilution refrigerator and its wiring were found to be fundamentally unreliable.", "B": "Because the pulse tube cooler’s vibration spikes made further measurements impossible.", "C": "Because the borrowed reference resonator failed to produce the expected spectral sharpening.", "D": "Because the supposedly high purity substrate was shown to be defective, undermining her qubit experiments."}, "correct_answer": "D", "explanation": "The paragraph explains that tests with a reference resonator showed the fridge and wiring were fine, leaving the substrate—riddled with microscopic two level systems—as the true problem. Once her advisor confirmed this, the committee decided the project had no viable path, so D is correct. A, B, and C are wrong because the equipment (fridge, wiring, cooler, and resonator) is ultimately shown not to be the cause of the problem."}
{"question": "What issue can cause fatigue test results for the aluminum bracket to become unusable, leading engineers to derate the design?", "choices": {"A": "Minor deviations in machine alignment or loose fixture bolts during testing", "B": "Using a sinusoidal load spectrum instead of a random load spectrum", "C": "Placing strain gauges only on the fillets and not on the bolt holes", "D": "Relying too heavily on finite element predictions of stress intensity"}, "correct_answer": "A", "explanation": "The paragraph states that minor deviations in machine alignment or loose fixture bolts can invalidate entire S–N curves, forcing engineers to derate the bracket. The other options mention aspects of the test setup and analysis that are described neutrally, not as the cause of unusable results."}
{"question": "Why did Lina ultimately decide to withdraw her quantum field theory manuscript?", "choices": {"A": "Because the peer reviewers requested that she shorten the manuscript and remove technical details", "B": "Because she discovered a simple error in her calculations that could be quickly corrected in a revised version", "C": "Because repeated attempts to fix anomalies led to deeper inconsistencies, convincing her that the whole research program had reached a conceptual dead end", "D": "Because she wanted to submit the same manuscript to a different journal without any major changes"}, "correct_answer": "C", "explanation": "Lina finds that every attempt to fix the anomaly creates new inconsistencies, turning her model into ad hoc corrections and leading her to conclude the research program is at a conceptual dead end; this motivates her withdrawal, matching option C. Options A, B, and D are not supported by the paragraph, which never mentions shortening, a simple correctable error, or resubmitting unchanged elsewhere."}
{"question": "What was Priya’s main conclusion after she reinterpreted her complicated update rule as a single operator on a Banach space?", "choices": {"A": "That the performance plateau was caused by errors in her simulation scripts and step-size choices.", "B": "That no algorithm satisfying her original constraints could asymptotically do better than plain stochastic gradient descent.", "C": "That changing the network topology would remove the plateau and improve convergence indefinitely.", "D": "That message delays and noise distributions were the only reasons for the observed plateau in performance."}, "correct_answer": "B", "explanation": "The paragraph states that once Priya viewed her update rule as a projection followed by a nonexpansive map, the plateau became a trivial corollary showing no algorithm respecting her constraints could asymptotically improve on plain stochastic gradient descent, which matches option B. Options A, C, and D introduce causes or fixes (script errors, topology changes, or delays/noise) that are not supported by the paragraph."}
{"question": "What was ultimately found to be the main cause of the bridge’s problems after it was built?", "choices": {"A": "A small design shortcut in the drainage holes that trapped rainwater around the bolts", "B": "A mistake in the steel grade that made the entire structure too weak to support people", "C": "A manufacturing defect in the concrete foundations that caused them to sink unevenly", "D": "Excessive salt in the sea air that rapidly corroded all exposed metal surfaces"}, "correct_answer": "A", "explanation": "The paragraph states that the main cause was a small design shortcut in the drainage holes that kept rainwater trapped where the bolts sat. The team checked the steel grade, the bolt supplier, and the salt spray in the air, but these were investigated and not identified as the main cause, so B, C, and D are incorrect."}

A is explicitly contrasted with the crucial skill, while C and D are later, more mechanical steps that follow once the conceptual architecture is sound."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of complexity in the study of algorithms?", "choices": {"A": "It measures how many commands a person types into a computer.", "B": "It describes the physical size and power of computer hardware.", "C": "It makes algorithms more difficult to understand and implement.", "D": "It compares how many steps algorithms take, helping judge their efficiency and guide design choices."}, "correct_answer": "D", "explanation": "The paragraph explains that complexity is about asking how many steps algorithms take, which lets us reason about programs and guides real design choices, so D is correct. A is wrong because typing commands is contrasted with the real focus of computer science. B is wrong because hardware size is never discussed. C is wrong because complexity is used to analyze efficiency, not to make algorithms harder to understand."}
{"question": "What main lesson did the production incident teach the author about their backend system?", "choices": {"A": "That Kubernetes pods were inherently unreliable and needed to be replaced", "B": "That relying on careful unit tests alone was not enough to prevent serious failures", "C": "That the message queues were the only true source of the system’s performance problems", "D": "That refreshing dashboards frequently would eventually reveal all critical issues"}, "correct_answer": "B", "explanation": "The author states that they once believed careful unit tests would shield the backend from catastrophic failures, but the incident showed this assumption was naive, meaning tests alone were not enough. Option A is incorrect because the paragraph does not blame Kubernetes itself. Option C is wrong because message queues are mentioned only in the context of stricter schemas as a mitigation, not as the sole performance problem. Option D is wrong because the dashboards “revealed almost nothing,” not all critical issues."}
{"question": "What conclusion do the students reach from their bean plant experiment in the biology lab?", "choices": {"A": "More water always makes the plants grow the tallest, no matter where they are placed.", "B": "Plants in complete darkness grow strongest because they do not lose energy to light.", "C": "The type of ruler used to measure the plants is the most important factor in their growth.", "D": "Plants near the sunny window grow strongest, showing that light helps photosynthesis and healthy development."}, "correct_answer": "D", "explanation": "The paragraph explains that the plants near the window usually grow strongest, and that this result helps students feel confident about how light affects photosynthesis and healthy development, which matches choice D. The text does not say that more water makes plants tallest (A), that plants in darkness grow strongest (B), or that the ruler type affects growth (C)."}
{"question": "What is the main concern expressed about the impact of technical and methodological advances in the life sciences?", "choices": {"A": "They can increase uncertainty about which biological phenomena are truly understood.", "B": "They consistently eliminate conflicting interpretations and clarify causal mechanisms.", "C": "They mainly expose errors in older imaging techniques while confirming most past conclusions.", "D": "They show that biological systems are simple enough for exhaustive exploration of all models."}, "correct_answer": "A", "explanation": "The paragraph concludes that technical progress can leave researchers feeling less certain about what they truly understand, so A is correct. B is wrong because the text says multiple plausible models and incompatible interpretations persist. C is wrong because it states that many findings shrink or vanish rather than being confirmed. D is wrong because it emphasizes that parameter spaces defy exhaustive exploration, not that systems are simple."}
{"question": "What is the main outcome of the researcher’s prolonged work on the plasma physics model?", "choices": {"A": "They end up with discouraging bounds showing what the theory cannot reliably predict.", "B": "They successfully remove all uncertainties and obtain highly precise growth rates.", "C": "They find that including higher order terms completely resolves all modeling issues.", "D": "They discover that all different parameter regimes are clearly distinguishable numerically."}, "correct_answer": "A", "explanation": "The paragraph explains that after months of work, the main quantitative result is a set of discouraging bounds on what the theory cannot reliably predict, showing a contraction of physical insight. The other options contradict the text: uncertainties are not removed (B), higher order terms do not fully resolve issues (C), and the regimes are described as almost indistinguishable within numerical tolerance, not clearly distinguishable (D)."}
{"question": "What main idea did the student take away from the pendulum experiment?", "choices": {"A": "Measurements in experiments tell a story about the place, tools, and people involved, not just about matching textbook values.", "B": "The goal of every physics lab is to exactly reproduce the famous value of 9.8 meters per second squared.", "C": "Simple pendulums are too inaccurate to be useful for measuring gravity in any situation.", "D": "Air resistance is the only factor that affects the result of a pendulum experiment in the lab."}, "correct_answer": "A", "explanation": "The student concludes that the real lesson is that every careful measurement carries a story about the place, tools, and people, rather than perfectly matching the textbook number, which matches option A. Option B incorrectly claims exact matching is the goal. Option C wrongly says pendulums are too inaccurate to be useful. Option D incorrectly focuses only on air resistance, ignoring other factors like length misreadings."}
{"question": "What change occurred after Marta manufactured the second bracket and repeated the tests?", "choices": {"A": "The accelerometers stopped sending data to the acquisition laptop during the test run.", "B": "The measured stress distribution showed an even larger deviation from the finite element model.", "C": "The test results matched the simulation within tolerance, so she chose this as the baseline design for fatigue testing.", "D": "The hydraulic actuator failed to complete its stroke cycle, preventing her from collecting usable data."}, "correct_answer": "C", "explanation": "The paragraph states that after making a second bracket and retesting, the deflection curves, modal frequencies, and peak stresses matched the simulation within the specified tolerance, and she recorded this configuration as the baseline design for further fatigue testing, which is described in option C. Options A, B, and D are not mentioned and contradict the successful, accurate test outcome described."}
{"question": "What did Mark ultimately discover was causing his distributed cache prototype to stall under high load?", "choices": {"A": "A rare deadlock cycle between two helper threads that only appeared under a precise interleaving of context switches", "B": "A persistent network bandwidth limitation that prevented packets from being delivered quickly enough", "C": "A hardware failure in one of the lab servers that intermittently shut down processing cores", "D": "A configuration mistake in the benchmark tool that generated far fewer requests than expected"}, "correct_answer": "A", "explanation": "The paragraph explains that a careful replay using recorded traffic revealed a rare deadlock cycle between two helper threads as the cause of the stalls, making A correct. There is no mention of network bandwidth problems (B), hardware failures (C), or configuration mistakes in the benchmarking tool (D)."}
{"question": "What does Mira ultimately realize about genetic inheritance while working on her assignment?", "choices": {"A": "It can always be perfectly explained using only simple dominance and recessiveness rules.", "B": "The sample data in the textbook must be incorrect because it does not match her predictions.", "C": "It is often more complex, involving factors like incomplete dominance, multiple genes, and environment, so her model can only be approximate.", "D": "It is too confusing to study, so she should abandon genetics and focus on another subject."}, "correct_answer": "C", "explanation": "Mira concludes that real inheritance often includes incomplete dominance, multiple genes, and environmental influences, so her model will always be approximate, which matches option C. Option A is wrong because she sees that simple rules do not always work. Option B is wrong because she does not blame the textbook data. Option D is wrong because she accepts the complexity rather than giving up on genetics."}
{"question": "What did the author describe as the most satisfying part of their PhD work?", "choices": {"A": "Collecting large numbers of genetic sequences from many different organisms", "B": "Discovering a single statistical result that clearly proved one hypothesis", "C": "Seeing theory and data gradually align into a coherent hierarchy of hypotheses", "D": "Designing new laboratory equipment to speed up experimental measurements"}, "correct_answer": "C", "explanation": "The author states that the most satisfying moment was the gradual convergence between theory and data, when competing hypotheses formed a coherent hierarchy, which matches option C. The paragraph does not say the highlight was simply collecting sequences (A), a single statistical result (B), or designing equipment (D)."}
{"question": "What conclusion does the narrator reach by the end of the lab session?", "choices": {"A": "They feel confident that they finally understand the lab equipment.", "B": "They decide to stay late and finish the report template on their own.", "C": "They realize that recording uncertainties makes their data look much better.", "D": "They feel that physics is slowly deciding they do not belong in the subject."}, "correct_answer": "D", "explanation": "The last sentence states that the narrator left the room feeling that physics was slowly deciding they did not belong there, so D is correct. A is wrong because the narrator is confused and pretending to understand. B is wrong because the lab period ends with the template half empty and they leave. C is wrong because recording uncertainties makes the numbers look uglier, not better."}
{"question": "What does the paragraph say usually happens as someone gains practice with algorithms, data structures, and abstraction?", "choices": {"A": "The terms become less mysterious and start to feel like useful tools for building programs.", "B": "The terms become harder to understand and are mostly replaced by simpler words in code.", "C": "The terms stay confusing, but programmers learn to ignore them while writing code.", "D": "The terms only make sense after fully mastering every detail of computer hardware."}, "correct_answer": "A", "explanation": "The paragraph states that with practice, the words stop feeling mysterious and start to feel like helpful tools for turning ideas into programs, which matches option A. Options B, C, and D contradict this by saying the terms get harder, remain confusing, or require full hardware mastery, none of which is mentioned in the paragraph."}

The other options describe uses in reef repair, storage without use, or decorative aquarium lighting, none of which are mentioned in the text."}
{"question": "What conclusion does Lena reach about her experience by the end of the paragraph?", "choices": {"A": "She decides that theoretical sketches are useless compared to hands-on work in the machine shop.", "B": "She feels that winning first place is the only meaningful proof of her engineering skills.", "C": "She realizes that her bridge design was a failure because it held less weight than expected.", "D": "She recognizes that patient design and careful testing are starting to feel natural to her."}, "correct_answer": "D", "explanation": "The paragraph ends by stating that the bridge’s quiet accuracy felt like proof that patient design and careful testing were becoming second nature to Lena, which matches choice D. Choice A is wrong because she sees the value of the class sketches when they turn into data. Choice B is wrong because the bridge did not win, yet she still feels validated. Choice C is wrong because the bridge held more weight than their original estimate, not less."}
{"question": "What change occurred in the author's approach to working with the autonomous scheduling algorithm?", "choices": {"A": "They stopped using the algorithm entirely and reverted to manual scheduling.", "B": "They decided to ignore anomalies because the algorithm already met all fairness criteria.", "C": "They focused only on improving computational efficiency instead of examining the results.", "D": "They moved from simply fixing bugs to questioning which human values could be represented in the model."}, "correct_answer": "D", "explanation": "The paragraph explains that the author shifted from patching code and treating anomalies as bugs to interrogating which human values were even representable in the model, making D correct. A, B, and C are not mentioned and contradict the described shift in focus toward deeper value representation rather than abandonment, ignoring anomalies, or just efficiency concerns."}

Options A, B, and C describe parts of the lab experience but are not said to be what stayed with the narrator the most."}
{"question": "What was the main change in how the narrator approached physics problems by the end of the term?", "choices": {"A": "They memorized more formulas so they could solve each problem by direct calculation.", "B": "They stopped reviewing physics during their walks home and relied only on class notes.", "C": "They began to treat every homework problem as completely new and unrelated to others.", "D": "They looked for which basic principle applied, using patterns they had learned from their routine walks."}, "correct_answer": "D", "explanation": "The paragraph explains that by the end of the term, the narrator no longer treated each problem as new but instead searched for which basic principle applied, a habit developed during the walks, which matches D. A is wrong because the shift was from formulas to ideas, not simply more memorization. B is wrong because the walks continued as a form of review. C is the opposite of what the paragraph states, since problems felt less separate, not more."}
{"question": "What problem did Lena ultimately identify as the source of the anomaly she was investigating?", "choices": {"A": "A hardware failure on several GPU nodes causing training jobs to crash", "B": "An overloaded message queue dropping training messages at peak times", "C": "Contention on a shared mutex protecting a cache of model shards", "D": "A network outage between the lab and the remote data center servers"}, "correct_answer": "C", "explanation": "The paragraph states that Lena narrowed the anomaly to a microservice handling gradient aggregation, whose logs showed occasional contention on a shared mutex guarding a cache of model shards, identifying this as the issue. The other options are not mentioned in the paragraph: there is no hardware failure (A), no message dropping due to overload (B), and no network outage between locations (D)."}
{"question": "What conclusion did the engineering team reach about the drone airframe after repeated testing and modeling attempts?", "choices": {"A": "They confirmed the airframe met all requirements and could be certified without changes.", "B": "They decided to ignore the strain discrepancies because no delamination was found thermographically.", "C": "They determined the current configuration could not be certified and would need a substantial redesign and schedule delay.", "D": "They concluded that adjusting joint stiffness and ply orientations had fully resolved the correlation issues."}, "correct_answer": "C", "explanation": "The paragraph states that it became clear the current configuration could not be certified without a substantial redesign and schedule slippage, which matches option C. Option A is wrong because the airframe did not meet requirements. Option B is wrong because the team did not ignore the discrepancies. Option D is wrong because tuning the model did not fully resolve the issues and only worked at one load level."}
{"question": "Why did repeating the experiment many times still not make the measured acceleration match the expected value?", "choices": {"A": "Because the random errors from bumps and air currents became larger with more trials", "B": "Because the students kept changing the angle of the ramp during the experiment", "C": "Because the stopwatch they used ran at different speeds in each trial", "D": "Because the worn-away zero mark on the meter stick caused the distance to be wrong in the same way every time"}, "correct_answer": "D", "explanation": "The paragraph explains that the average still did not match the expected value because the meter stick’s zero mark was worn away, so every distance measurement had the same fixed error, which repetition could not remove. A is incorrect because random errors are reduced by averaging. B and C are not mentioned as problems in the paragraph."}
{"question": "Why does the paragraph describe basic programming as a friendly way to explore modern computing?", "choices": {"A": "Because it lets you program without ever making mistakes or needing to test your code", "B": "Because it only involves drawing pictures and never changing anything on the screen", "C": "Because it allows you to control the computer without understanding what happens in memory or on the screen", "D": "Because testing and fixing code gives direct feedback that makes abstract ideas like loops and variables feel real"}, "correct_answer": "D", "explanation": "The paragraph explains that basic programming is friendly because testing and fixing code provides direct feedback, making abstract ideas like loops, variables, and conditions feel real. A is wrong because the paragraph mentions testing and fixing mistakes. B is wrong because the text talks about changing pixels and scores, not just drawing pictures. C is wrong because the paragraph emphasizes understanding how the computer reads lines, moves numbers in memory, and changes the screen."}
{"question": "What is a main difficulty that many students experience in intro programming courses?", "choices": {"A": "They quickly finish the material and run out of new topics to study.", "B": "They spend most of their time designing creative projects instead of learning syntax.", "C": "They are given too many visible clues about what is wrong when a bug appears.", "D": "They feel stuck dealing with bugs, error messages, and strict logic instead of seeing creative results."}, "correct_answer": "D", "explanation": "The paragraph explains that many learners feel stuck handling bugs, error messages, and confusing logic and therefore do not see creative results, making computing feel like a struggle with strict, invisible logic; this matches option D. Options A, B, and C contradict the text, which describes slow, confusing progress, not quickly finishing material, focusing on creative projects, or having obvious clues about bugs."}
{"question": "What happened as a result of the repeated contamination in the yeast experiment?", "choices": {"A": "The students decided to stop using incubators for all future experiments.", "B": "The students discovered that the drug completely stopped yeast growth.", "C": "The students extended the experiment for several extra weeks to collect more data.", "D": "The students had to cancel an analysis session and rewrite their reports using a simpler experiment."}, "correct_answer": "D", "explanation": "The paragraph states that because contamination kept returning, the project schedule slipped and they had to cancel a planned analysis session and rewrite their lab reports around another, simpler experiment, which matches option D. The text never mentions abandoning incubators (A), finding that the drug stopped yeast growth (B), or extending the experiment for weeks (C)."}
{"question": "What was the main change in the narrator’s perspective by the end of the paragraph?", "choices": {"A": "They began to see physics theory as a connected landscape, making advanced concepts feel less intimidating and more inviting.", "B": "They decided that non-equilibrium systems were too complicated and chose to avoid them in future studies.", "C": "They realized that only detailed equations and technical corrections mattered in understanding physical systems.", "D": "They concluded that emergent order could not be captured by simple models and abandoned that approach."}, "correct_answer": "A", "explanation": "The paragraph ends with the narrator describing how presenting a simple toy model led them to see theory as a connected landscape, which made advanced concepts feel less intimidating and more inviting. The other options contradict this: they do not decide to avoid the topic (B), they move beyond just equations and corrections (C), and they successfully use a simple model rather than abandoning it (D)."}
