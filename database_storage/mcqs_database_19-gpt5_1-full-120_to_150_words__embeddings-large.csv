"According to the paragraph, why can a bridge with more compliant joints and sliding interfaces be more reliable than a seemingly rigid one?","{'A': 'Because added flexibility allows controlled movement that safely redirects energy away from critical components.', 'B': 'Because flexible joints eliminate the need for finite element modeling and field measurements.', 'C': 'Because increased softness makes the bridge completely unaffected by wind, traffic, and seismic activity.', 'D': 'Because compliant joints automatically repair local stiffness variations and construction tolerances over time.'}",A,"Option A is correct because the paragraph explains that designers introduce deliberate softness so energy is shifted away from critical components, and that controlled movement leads to higher reliability. B is wrong because modeling and measurements are still used. C is wrong because the paragraph only says these devices control vibrations, not eliminate their effects. D is wrong because nothing in the text says joints repair stiffness variations or tolerances."
How does Leah’s experience with the physics problem affect the way she thinks by the end of the paragraph?,"{'A': 'She decides physics is too confusing and stops doing her homework altogether.', 'B': 'She becomes frustrated that small changes in assumptions never change the ball’s path.', 'C': 'She realizes that careful, step-by-step reasoning can also help her plan her own week.', 'D': 'She chooses to ignore the equations and rely only on her intuition for both physics and planning.'}",C,"The paragraph explains that by the time Leah finishes, she is using the same calm, step-by-step reasoning from the physics problem to plan her week, so C is correct. A is wrong because she does not quit her homework. B is wrong because she notices small changes do create different paths. D is wrong because she focuses on equations and reasoning, not ignoring them."
"According to the paragraph, how has the author’s view of mismatches between models and experiments changed over time?","{'A': 'The author has come to see them as useful, because specific failures can reveal deeper organizing principles.', 'B': 'The author now ignores them, believing that single measurements are too trivial to matter in systems biology.', 'C': 'The author has grown convinced they are always caused by poor experimental technique and should be eliminated.', 'D': 'The author now believes that only perfectly fitting models are valuable for understanding biological systems.'}",A,"The paragraph states that the author has come to welcome mismatches, because when a model fails in a specific way, it can reveal a new, deeper organizing principle (A). The author does not say they ignore mismatches (B), blame them solely on poor technique (C), or value only perfectly fitting models (D); in fact, the passage argues the opposite of C and D."
"According to the paragraph, what did the writer realize was the main improvement after using the Python script in the lab?","{'A': 'That the script ran extremely fast after many optimizations to its code', 'B': 'That the simple rule about where files could be saved changed the group’s behavior', 'C': 'That testing the script on messy folders completely eliminated coding errors', 'D': 'That storing notes in a CSV file made the biology project scientifically more accurate'}",B,"The writer concludes that the main improvement was the simple rule the script enforced so no one could save files outside the structure, which changed their shared habit. The paragraph does not say speed was the main benefit (A), that testing eliminated all coding errors (C), or that the CSV file made the project more scientifically accurate (D)."
Why did Lin rewrite the message protocol for her distributed logging service?,"{'A': 'Because the integration tests were failing to start on the campus lab machines', 'B': 'Because her service had flooded the cluster with duplicate log entries overnight', 'C': 'Because the leader election algorithm could not converge during manual failover', 'D': 'Because one of the monitors in the lab stopped displaying packet traces correctly'}",B,"The paragraph states that overnight her distributed logging service had flooded the cluster with duplicate entries, so she rewrote the message protocol to enforce idempotent append operations. The other options mention test startup, leader election issues, or monitor problems, none of which are given as reasons for rewriting the protocol."
Why might a modern bridge end up with more compliant joints and sliding interfaces than a layperson would expect?,"{'A': 'Because flexible joints are cheaper and easier to install than traditional rigid steel connections.', 'B': 'Because added flexibility helps control and redirect vibrations, increasing the bridge’s overall reliability.', 'C': 'Because construction tolerances and local stiffness variations always force engineers to reduce structural rigidity.', 'D': 'Because field measurements usually show that rigid connections are unsafe and must be removed entirely.'}",B,"The paragraph explains that designers introduce deliberate softness so that controlled movement and shifted energy paths increase reliability, so B is correct. A is not mentioned as a cost or installation issue. C is wrong because engineers do not say tolerances always force reduced rigidity. D is incorrect because the text does not claim rigid connections are usually unsafe or removed entirely."
What did Leah do differently by the time she finished her physics homework?,"{'A': 'She used the same calm, step-by-step reasoning to plan her own week.', 'B': 'She decided to stop doing physics homework altogether.', 'C': 'She went outside to test the ball’s motion in real life.', 'D': 'She rewrote the textbook solution in her own words.'}",A,"The paragraph states that by the time Leah finished, she was using the same calm, step-by-step reasoning to plan her own week, so A is correct. The text does not mention her quitting homework (B), going outside to test the ball (C), or rewriting the textbook solution (D)."
Why does the author come to welcome mismatches between models and experiments?,"{'A': 'Because they show that the experimental methods are too inaccurate to be useful', 'B': 'Because they reveal where hidden assumptions limit understanding and can lead to deeper organizing principles', 'C': 'Because they prove that studying isolated genes is better than studying regulatory networks', 'D': 'Because they indicate that the models now perfectly capture the complexity of cellular processes'}",B,"The author says that gaps between prediction and experiment often mark where assumptions constrain what life is allowed to do and that the most productive insight comes when a model fails in a way that reveals a new organizing principle, which matches choice B. Choices A, C, and D contradict the paragraph, which does not blame only experimental inaccuracy, reject network-level study, or claim that mismatches mean models are perfect."
What did the writer realize was the main improvement after using the Python script in the computer lab?,"{'A': 'That the script’s speed and detailed optimizations were the most important benefits', 'B': 'That organizing the files by hand would have been more effective than using any script', 'C': 'That the key change was the rule and shared habit of saving files within a structured system', 'D': 'That storing notes in a CSV file was unnecessary for the biology project'}",C,"The paragraph explains that the main improvement was not the script’s technical details but the simple rule it enforced, which led to a new shared habit of saving files within the structure (C). Option A is wrong because the author downplays speed and tiny optimizations. Option B is wrong because the script is presented as helpful, not worse than manual work. Option D is wrong because the text never suggests that the CSV notes were unnecessary."
What main problem was Lin trying to fix in her distributed logging service during the night in the campus lab?,"{'A': 'A failure in the leader election algorithm that prevented any node from becoming leader', 'B': 'A hotspot in the network caused by a permanently offline storage node', 'C': 'Duplicate log entries flooding the cluster and causing inconsistency among replicas', 'D': 'Insufficient disk space on several shards leading to loss of old log data'}",C,"The paragraph states that her service had flooded the cluster with duplicate entries, and she rewrote the message protocol and refactored the storage layer to address this and ensure consistency. A mentions leader election but that was tested, not the original problem; B misstates the cause of the hotspot and ignores the duplicate entries; D is not mentioned at all in the paragraph."
